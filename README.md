  ## Description:
 The objective of this application is to create an Employee Tracker. The user may quickly view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in their company using command line inputs. The below criteria was kept in mind when creating this application:

GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
WHEN I start the application
THEN I am presented with the following options: view all departments, view all roles, view all employees, add a department, add a role, add an employee, and update an employee role
WHEN I choose to view all departments
THEN I am presented with a formatted table showing department names and department ids
WHEN I choose to view all roles
THEN I am presented with the job title, role id, the department that role belongs to, and the salary for that role
WHEN I choose to view all employees
THEN I am presented with a formatted table showing employee data, including employee ids, first names, last names, job titles, departments, salaries, and managers that the employees report to
WHEN I choose to add a department
THEN I am prompted to enter the name of the department and that department is added to the database
WHEN I choose to add a role
THEN I am prompted to enter the name, salary, and department for the role and that role is added to the database
WHEN I choose to add an employee
THEN I am prompted to enter the employeeâ€™s first name, last name, role, and manager, and that employee is added to the database
WHEN I choose to update an employee role
THEN I am prompted to select an employee to update and their new role and this information is updated in the database

  ## Installation:
 The JavaScript code can be downloaded via the Employee Tracker folder on my Github page.

  ## Usage:
  This Employee Tracker is intended for easy navigation by using the command line interface. The user begins by typing 'node index.js' in the command line. The prompts are intuitive and user inputs from the command line will be used to view and edit company informaiton.
